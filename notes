edit this file for any changes/functions for this ugly looking and not really working app 

!!!!!!!TO RUN THE APP!!!!!!!
right click pom.xml and click open in integrated terminal
run 
./run.sh
then go to chrome and go to 
http://localhost:8080/

username is username 
password is password

if i every manage to connect to mysql will put the codes and settings in the file

current code is just static app for a single user and without the use of mysql, and quite ugly looking
Ohya 

to debug
    try to figure out why the update function for budget is not working
    try to figure out why the calendar popup not showing up for adding/updating spending


frontend
    change the colour its so ugly

functions
    to connect to mysql
        will delete all the variable String username from budget and spending 
        after i connect successfully, hopefully
        this may also help to update the changes for budget and spending (i think?)

    the purpose of budget was to have a progress bar for every category (optional since sounds like headache)
        for eg the budget for food is 300 and spending for the month is 60 will show 60/300 progress bar
        will try to figure out how to do this for both the frontend and the logic

    a checklist for the user (for eg groceries that should be purchased every month)
        this will be refreshed per month
        (or every two weeks if they set it they way if possible although currently idk how)
        preferably a link to ntuc or lazada or whatever shopping websites 
        (maybe should ask for their preferences at setting or something)
        (or to go the google link for that item we see whatever we can do)

        but once ticked they will be reminded to add it to the spending (like the amount)

    a pie chart to show the percentage of spendings for different category (hopefully can be colourful)
    like those bank statements 
        this can be done using bootstrap but the logic is one big headache

    change the spending desc to a table of buttons 
    (consists of options like lunch dinner or shopping(the categories))
        can also be done using bootstrap but the code is also one big headache
        will settle this soon (i hope) since i think i kind of figured out how to do this
